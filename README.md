# NNAPI Example

*Run neural network on your Android phone using the new NNAPI !*

Android 8.1 introduces Neural Networks API (NNAPI). Though it is in beta, it's very exciting to run a model in the "native" way supported by Android System. :)

This project is a simple demo of NNAPI. It uses extracted weights of LeNet and recongnize a handwritten number.

## Preparation

Please make sure the Android System on your phone is 8.1+

Please push the weights and biases in the folder `weights_and_biases` to your phone. And modify the path in `native-lib.cpp` if necessary.

## Workaround for UnsatisfiedLinkError

You will get a `UnsatisfiedLinkError` about `ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs` if you compile the project. It is a known bug. Please use the following workaround from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46987602/unsatisfiedlinkerror-on-aneuralnetworksmodel-identifyinputsandoutputs-in-nnapi-o):

In your NDK's android/NeuralNetworks.h, replace the declaration of `ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs` by

```
__attribute__((weak))
extern "C" int ANeuralNetworksModel_setInputsAndOutputs(
        ANeuralNetworksModel* model,
        uint32_t inputCount, const uint32_t* inputs, uint32_t outputCount,
        const uint32_t* outputs);

extern "C" int ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs(
        ANeuralNetworksModel* model,
        uint32_t inputCount, const uint32_t* inputs, uint32_t outputCount,
        const uint32_t* outputs) {

    return ANeuralNetworksModel_setInputsAndOutputs(
            model, inputCount, inputs, outputCount, outputs);
}
```
