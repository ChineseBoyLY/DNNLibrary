# DNNLibrary

*Run neural network on your Android phone using the new NNAPI !*

Android 8.1 introduces Neural Networks API (NNAPI). Though it is in beta, it's very exciting to run a model in the "native" way supported by Android System. :)

DNNLirary is a wrapper of NNAPI. It lets you easily make the use of the new NNAPI introduced in Android 8.1. You can convert your caffemodel into `daq` format by the [convert tool](https://github.com/daquexian/DNN_convert_tool) and run the model directly. 

The demo in this repo uses extracted weights of ResNet-18 to recongnize images(ResNet-18 branch), and also uses extracted weights of LeNet and recongnize a handwritten number(LeNet branch).

## Introduction

Android 8.1 introduces NNAPI. From my experient it is very efficient on my Pixel. For example, it takes [caffe-android-lib](https://github.com/sh1r0/caffe-android-lib) an average time of 43.42ms to do a convolution with 20 5\*5 filters on 224\*224 image, but it only takes 15.45ms for NNAPI -- about 1/3 of caffe-android-lib.

What's more, we can believe [depthwise convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), which is useful on mobile devices, is optimized in NNAPI. It takes caffe-android-lib and NNAPI 82.32ms and 16.93ms respectively to do 5 * 5 depthwise conv on 224 \* 224 \* 20 input.

However, NNAPI is not friendly to normal Android developers. It is not designed to be used by normal developers directly. So I wrapped it into a library.

With DNNLibrary it's extremely easy to deploy your caffe model on Android 8.1+ phone. Here is my code to deploy the ResNet-18 on phone:

```
ModelWrapper.readFile(getAssets(), "resnet18");
ModelWrapper.setOutput("prob");
ModelWrapper.compile(ModelWrapper.PREFERENCE_FAST_SINGLE_ANSWER);

float[] result = ModelWrapper.predict(inputData);
```

Only four lines! And the model file is got from my [convert tool](https://github.com/daquexian/DNN_convert_tool) from pretrained caffemodel.

If you use the "raw" NNAPI, the code will increase dramatically. Setting up a LeNet needs 200+ lines. (For the 200+ lines LeNet you can check out the second commit of this repo)

## Usage

This library uses beta version of NDK which is not supported by jCenter/JitPack now, so I can't publish this library until they support NDK r16. Please download [dnnlibrary-release.aar](https://github.com/daquexian/DNNLibrary/raw/ResNet-18/dnnlibrary-release.aar) in this repo and [import it in your project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library.html#AddDependency).

## Preparation

Please make sure the Android System on your phone is 8.1+, or you may want to use API 27 emulator. The [beta version of NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html#beta-downloads) is necessary for NNAPI. If you want to compile the demo please use Android Studio 3.0+.
